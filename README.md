üéØ Project Overview

This project serves as a comprehensive manual testing suite for a simulated E-commerce application, ShopWise. The goal was to demonstrate core Software Quality Analyst (SQA) skills by focusing on Test Documentation, Defect Tracking, and Platform Agnostic Testing (Web/Mobile), as required for modern product development environments.

This work specifically addresses the need to create "detailed and comprehensive test plans and test cases" for products spanning "web & Android/iOS devices," as outlined in the SQA job description.
