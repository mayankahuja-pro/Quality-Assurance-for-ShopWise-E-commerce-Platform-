# **Quality Assurance for "ShopWise" E-commerce Platform**

## **üéØ Project Overview**

This project serves as a comprehensive Quality Assurance (QA) suite for a simulated **E-commerce** application, **ShopWise**, focusing on the critical Shopping Cart and Order Placement modules.

The goal was to demonstrate core **Software Quality Analyst (SQA)** skills by generating essential test artifacts and analyses, directly addressing the need to create "detailed and comprehensive test plans and test cases" for products spanning **Web & Android/iOS devices**, and exhibiting **attention to detail**.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Key Deliverables**

| Artifact | Description | JD Skill Alignment |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Test\_Plan\_ShopWise.md** | Outlines the scope, strategy, objectives, and environment for testing the Shopping Cart Module. | **Create comprehensive Test Plans.** |
| **Test\_Cases\_ShopWise.md** | Detailed matrix of **10+ manual test cases** (Positive, Negative, Boundary) covering Web and Mobile views. | **Create detailed and comprehensive Test Cases.** |
| **API\_Test\_Scenarios.md** | Defines test cases for backend endpoints (GET and POST) to verify product data retrieval and cart updates. | **Basic knowledge of API's.** |
| **SQL\_Test\_Scenarios.md** | Outlines specific **SQL queries** required to verify data integrity post-transaction (e.g., checking inventory deduction, order status). | **Basic knowledge of SQL.** |
| **Defect\_Report\_ShopWise.md** | Formal documentation for a high-priority bug (SW-CART-001) found during execution, including steps to reproduce. | **Identify bugs and communicate them proactively.** |
| **shopwise\_app.html** | A simple mock E-commerce front-end application (System Under Test, SUT) used for manual execution. | **Basic knowledge of HTML/CSS** (used for defect inspection). |

## **üîó Technical Skills Showcased**

* **Manual Testing:** Executed functional, usability, platform, and regression tests.  
* **Backend Validation:** Demonstrated ability to verify server-side logic and data persistence using mock **API and SQL** checks.  
* **Platform Agnostic Testing:** Conducted responsiveness and usability testing across simulated **Web** and **Mobile** (Android/iOS) viewports.  
* **Professional Documentation:** Adherence to standard industry formats for Test Plans, Test Cases, and Defect Reports.

## **üíª How to View and Execute**

To view the mock application and manually execute the test cases:

1. Download or clone this repository.  
2. Open the **shopwise\_app.html** file in any modern web browser.  
3. Use the browser's developer tools (F12) to switch to the **mobile emulation mode** to test the responsiveness and mobile-specific test cases.
